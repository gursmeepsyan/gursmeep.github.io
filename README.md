## PROJECT EXPERIENCE
### •	Pacman-Reinforcement-AI 
-	Developed through Agile Methodologies. Implemented various reinforcement learning algorithms which make AI play the game of Pacman, including model-based and model-free approaches, as well as search algorithms such as depth- first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* in Python to solve Pacman maze problems, and applied adversarial and stochastic search techniques using multiagent Minimax and Expectimax algorithms to improve Pacman's movement.
### •	Cybersecurity Threat Analysis 
-	Analyzed time series data from 2006-2010 to protect critical operating infrastructures like SCADA and Electrical Power grid, performing PCA to identify key variables, covariance measurements, and Univariate/Multivariate HMM training using RStudio packages like ggbiplot, depmix, and plyr, while also checking for anomalies.
### •	Software Engineering & Game Development (Java & Android Studio) – Scrum and Kanban
- FindMatch Game App (May 2020) – Focused on matching images of a given card to images in other cards of the deck within a time limit. Implemented intents to access objects across packages such as UI and Game Classes. Used Flickr To and import for things such as Number of images, game theme. Created separate classes for game mode, difficulty level and created Options menu screen from which the values of these objects can all be modified with some other special features.
-	ZombieSweeper Game App (June 2020) – Inspired from classical minesweeper game, theme changed to finding zombies and many other added features. Launched Intents across UI and gameModes packages and saved high scores for future purposes. Used Gradle for build processes and developed special tests cases for each aspect of the game including JUnit. Group project developed through Agile techniques (Git).
### •	Data Modelling with AI/ML	
-	Problem: Predict outcome group (hospitalized, nonhospitalized, deceased, recovered) for COVID-positive individuals using classification models based on F1-score comparison. 
-	Data Preparation: Selected impactful features (age, country, chronic disease, deaths, active, case fatality ratio), mapped categorical features, and balanced classes using RandomOverSampler. 
-	Classification Models: Trained and tuned models (Random Forest, Extra-Trees, AdaBoost) with hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation. Model Selection: Chose Random Forest as best performer based on macro F1- scores, “deceased” F1-scores, and overall accuracy.
### •	Covid-19 Cough Audio Analysis 
-	Used Python, R and Hadoop for extraction of features such as cough audio samples, person’s age, region etc from Healthcare Data of India and Italy to build a model to predict if person can be classified as covid positive.
-	 Dealt with audio files using librosa package and spectral lines to successfully boost the accuracy to 77% with only 13% TYPE 1 error.


## CERTIFICATIONS
